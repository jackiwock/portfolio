<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I am a recent graduate with a master's in Computational Social Science and a background in teaching. Thus far, my life has been a series of new environments, people, and experiences. My time living and working in New Zealand, teaching in China, and studying in Sweden grants me a unique perspective on public policy, health, education, and childhood/adolescent development. My interests lie namely in the challenges that modern adolescents face in relation to health behaviors and outcomes, growing up in the shadow of social media. I am looking forward a career in research to investigate these issues.
