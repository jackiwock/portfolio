  # About Me
</div>

I am a recent graduate with a master's in Computational Social Science and I am excited to embark on a new chapter with Data Analysis. Thus far, my life has been a series of new environments, people and experiences. My time living and working in New Zealand, teaching in China and studying in Sweden grants me a unique perspective on public policy, health, education and childhood/adolescent development. My interests lie namely in the challenges that modern adolescents face in relation to health behaviors and outcomes, growing up in the shadow of social media. I am looking forward a career in data to investigate these issues.
